            <p class="project-description">
                One of my first projects within Boltrics was the development of the Boltrics API Extension. An API is an <emph>Application Programming Interface</emph> and is a piece of software that allows systems to talk to eachother.
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially, the development of the API Extension was started because customers requested a way to connect to their Dynamics 365 Business Central data to perform data analysis. One way to perform the data analysis is through PowerBI, for which Microsoft has created a connector to make connection to the Business Central API very simple. Later on, the new Boltrics Web Portal was also based on the API Extension.
            </p>
            <p>
                The API Extension was created using the API Page Type within the AL Language used for Dynamics 365 Business Central Development. The API page is a page that has no user interface, but is used for the definition of the web service. To enable rapid development of the API, a Python script was created to automatically generate API pages based on the definition of the tables in Business Central.
